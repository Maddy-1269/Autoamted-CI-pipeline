#  Automated CI Pipeline for a Web Application using Jenkins

##  Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to design and implement a **Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline** using **Jenkins** for a modern web application.  
The pipeline is triggered automatically whenever new code is pushed to a **GitHub repository**.  
It performs a series of automated steps — **code retrieval**, **dependency installation**, **testing**, **building**, and **artifact packaging** — ensuring that the application is always in a **ready-to-deploy state**.

This project focuses on **automation, reliability, and repeatability**, which are key principles of modern **DevOps** practices.

##  Objectives
- Learn how to install and configure Jenkins for CI pipelines.  
- Automate the build and test process of a web application.  
- Integrate GitHub with Jenkins using webhooks for automatic build triggers.  
- Generate and archive build artifacts for deployment.  
- Understand Jenkins pipeline concepts, credentials management, and job configuration.

##  Project Components

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Source Code** | A simple web application hosted on GitHub (Node.js / Python Flask / Java Spring Boot). |
| **Version Control** | GitHub repository to manage code changes and trigger Jenkins builds via webhooks. |
| **Jenkins Server** | The heart of the CI system. Automatically pulls code and executes the pipeline. |
| **Testing Framework** | Jest (Node.js), Pytest (Python), or JUnit (Java) to ensure code quality. |
| **Build Tool** | npm, Maven, or Gradle depending on chosen language. |
| **Artifact Storage** | Jenkins archives build outputs (.zip, .jar, .tar) for deployment. |

##  Pipeline Workflow (Step-by-Step)

### 1️⃣ Code Checkout
- Jenkins automatically connects to the GitHub repository.  
- On each **push** or **pull request**, Jenkins retrieves the latest code from the main branch.  

### 2️⃣ Dependency Installation
- Jenkins installs all required dependencies for the project.  
  - **Node.js:** `npm install`  
  - **Python:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
  - **Java:** `mvn install`  
- This ensures consistent build environments across developers and Jenkins.

### 3️⃣ Static Code Analysis (Optional)
- Tools like **ESLint**, **Flake8**, or **Checkstyle** are used for code quality checks.  
- The build fails if code doesn’t meet the quality standards.

### 4️⃣ Unit Testing
- Jenkins executes the unit test suite to verify application functionality.  
- Test reports are automatically generated and displayed in Jenkins.  
- The pipeline halts if any test fails.

### 5️⃣ Build and Package
- The app is compiled and packaged into a deployable format:
  - Node.js → bundled build directory  
  - Python → `.tar.gz` package  
  - Java → `.jar` or `.war` file  
- Jenkins archives the build artifact for future deployment.

### 6️⃣ Post-Build Actions
- Jenkins stores results and archived artifacts.
- Notifications (email/Slack) can be sent on success or failure.
- Provides visibility and feedback to the development team.
